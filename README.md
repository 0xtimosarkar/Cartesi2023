# QuantumCore

- spyware mechanisms
- data-exfiltration and infliltration
- reverse-shell
- integrated polymorphic-engine (multi-layer code obfuscation)
- DGA assisted file signature generator
- watchdog sentinel
- process-hollowing
- registry-persistence
- custom binary communication protocol (similar to QUIC; used as replacement for HTTPS, SFTP/FTP and more)
- unsupervised deep-learning algorithm (information gathering; getting a deep insight about how the user uses its machine and what he does)
- neural network engine (trained to react on multiple scenarios; e.g evasive detection)
- decentralized and takedown-resistant c2 infrastructure (based on peer-to-peer technology; integrated communications protocol)
