# Cartesi Hackathon 2023

This repository holds the implementation and whitepaper for my entry at the Cartesi Hackathon 2023.

## Project Structure

- **./whitepaper**: contains the whitepaper that describes this submission formally
- **./implementation**: contains the source code used for this submission

## Pre-Eliminary Project Ideas

- **decentralized cross-chain oracle**: useful for aggregating big datasets into on-chain ML models.
- **dROS**: decentralized version of pyROS. Probably not gonna work due to high computation need of pyROS
- **decentralized recruitation platform**: recruitation platform for DAOs and on-ramped companies. include self-sovereign DIDs (frontend, cartesi-backend)
- **decentralized password-vault**: Novel idea: splitting hashed passwords across a storage network like swarm to maximize security. write novel mechanism that splits pre-hashed passwords across a directed-graph lile storage network for encryption and decentralization. When reading pws, the splitting engine would match the splits and reverse-hash the pws. The pws will be read-write-only for their associated adresses. The smart-contracts for the splitter should be deployed on evm and backend/middle-end should be running on a cartesi rollup. Frontend for interacting with the vault using web3modal.
- **linux app for formal-verification and dApp auditing**
- **social-media platform using lens protocol. running on cartesi**


## Criteria and Judgement

We will score projects based on the following criteria, and each will be scored from 1 to 5 for a maximum of 25 points:

### Product-market fit and economic viability.

- Is it something that fills a current existing gap in the blockchain space?
- Is it something that people would want to use? Is there a demand for it?
- Is it something that is missing in this space at the moment?

### Originality and innovation.

- Is it something new/novel?
- Is it something new in terms of the product?
- Is it something new in terms of the code?

### Implementation quality.

- Here we look at the elegance of the solution. Is it designed well?

### Technical complexity.

- This one is quite self explanatory. We care about solutions that are interesting to look at from a technical standpoint.

### Level of completion.

- Which stage of development is your project at?
