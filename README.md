NebulaQ: An open-source mechanical design for a scalable planar ion-trapping quantum computer operating at room temperature

## Component Overview

- **Ceramic CPGA**: responsible for packaging and wire-bonding the surface ion trap. I chose CPGA as ion trap substrate due to its thermal strengths and isolation capabilities.
- **Surface Ion Trap**: directly milled onto the CPGA using CNC Milling techniques. The design includes a gold layer in order to work at UHV and XHV pressures. Surface Trap consists of certain RF and DC lanes including DC endcaps. This generates a electro-static field that is capable of trapping macro-particles or even ions in it.
- **UHV or XHV Chamber**:
- **Laser Optics**:
