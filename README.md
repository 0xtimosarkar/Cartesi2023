workflow

- autonomous scanning and assessment of the local environment. 
- identifying exposed vulnerabilities by using a deep learning model (trained by autoML using multiple CVE and YARA datasets)
- autonomous decision model for exploitation of found vulnerabilities
- scalable and adaptive approach. automatic enhanent of the dataset based on new decisions
- fully autonomous ai-powered propagation and replication
- polymorphic behaviour
- autonomous communication to the user/victim using a LLM
- stealth network activity by injecting eBPF packets into modified network traffic
- file-less in-memory operation
- anti-UPX abilities
- usage of process-hollowing (LD_PRELOAD and RegKeysâ‚¬
- decentralized onion routed command and control network
